# v3.1.1 (09/08/2023):

### Additions:
- Added the "Easy Bowser Throws" cheat.

### Changes:
- Added a fix for [Big Goombas getting marked as dead after getting punched](https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1651978702408876032) to the "Fix Various Bugs" setting.
- Made long jumping with the "Improved Controls" setting enabled behave exactly the same as long jumping without that setting enabled, so that performing BLJs is now much easier just like before.

### Fixes:
- Fixed King Bob-omb's eyes being rendered incorrectly.
- [Fixed compilation and audio issues on macOS](https://github.com/MorsGames/sm64plus/pull/83) thanks to [sofakng](https://github.com/sofakng).
- Fixed the modified credits text. (Hopefully!)
